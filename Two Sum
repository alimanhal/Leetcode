Explantion ðŸ‘‡:
      This code defines a method twoSum inside the Solution class to solve the "Two Sum" problem. 
The method iterates through a list of integers, nums, using two nested loops to check all possible 
pairs of elements. If a pair of elements adds up to the given target, it returns their indices as a 
list. The outer loop selects an element, and the inner loop checks every subsequent element to find 
a match. If no such pair is found, the method returns an empty tuple. This approach has a time
complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops.
